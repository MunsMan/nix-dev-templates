# My Nix Development Templates

## Introduction
Welcome to my collection of Nix development templates! This repository is my personal project where I am compiling a variety of customizable templates designed to streamline the development process. Whether you are new to Nix or an experienced user, these templates are crafted to offer flexibility and efficiency in managing development environments.

## Get Started

```{bash}
nix flake init --template github:munsman/nix-dev-templates#<project>
```

## What is Nix?
Nix is a powerful package management and system configuration tool for Linux and other Unix systems. It provides reproducible, declarative, and reliable environments, ideal for developers who value consistent and isolated development settings.

## Templates Overview
Here, you'll find a range of development templates suited for different scenarios. As this is an ongoing personal project, I regularly add new templates. Current offerings include:

- **esp-rs:** Effortlessly kickstart your ESP microcontroller projects in Rust with this template, featuring automated setup of essential toolchains and compilers. It's a time-saving solution, complete with build scripts and sample projects, ideal for both novice and seasoned developers.


## Getting Started
To utilize these templates, ensure you have Nix installed on your system. For installation instructions and further information about Nix, please visit [Nix's official website](https://nixos.org/nix/).

## Contributing
While this is primarily a personal project, I am open to suggestions and contributions. If you have a template to add or improvements to recommend, feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue.

## Stay Updated
As this is an evolving project, I frequently add new templates and features. Star and watch this repository to keep up with the latest additions!
